    each genotype, i in genotypes
        if genotype.rs2854464 == 'AA'
            p <b>#{names[genotype.id]}</b> has the high muscle strength <b>AA</b> mutation at ACVR1B, specifically tested on the knees. Beastly.
        else
            p <b>#{names[genotype.id]}</b> has genotype <b>#{genotype.rs2854464}</b>, and so <em>doesn't</em> have the mutation for high muscle strength. Shucks.
